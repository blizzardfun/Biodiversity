Belly button biodiversity dashboard project
 The belly button data can be examined from a table and three charts.The front end is built from HTML, Javascript,and D3. The table displays all meta data about the participant. A D3 pie chart, bubble chart and washing frequency gauge display data for the selected sample number. The Python / Flask back end with HTML and Javascript code starters were provided for this assignment.

 * Note: You'll need to use `sh run.sh` initiated from command line to run the visualization.  Requirements are noted in requirements.txt. This will host the page at ` http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.
